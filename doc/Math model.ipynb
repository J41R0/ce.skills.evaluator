    "Structurally a FCM can be represented as a digraph where the value of the causal relation between two nodes $c_i$ and $c_j$ is represented in component $w_{ij}$ that belongs to weight matrix $W$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The FCM's inference process is the propagation of each node weight to his neighbours over time. This process may be endless because the FCM topology may contain loops like a recurrent neural network. For this reason, two stop criteria are defined, a maximum number of iterations $T$ and a minimum difference between nodes vector $\\alpha$ in the times $t$ y $t+1$. The inference process is summarized in the following equation. \n",

    "In the current problem context, the FCM will represent the skills as the map concepts and the relations between skills as the edges. A verified skill value will be set and transformed to corresponding concept initial activation value. After all initial values are set the inference process will be executed until the stop criteria are fulfilled. Finally, the greatest activation value of each node is selected as the evaluation for the user skills. The nodes with an activation value greater than zero are the user final skills and corresponding activation value will be the skill evaluation.\n"
